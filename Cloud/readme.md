There is lot of reasons behind like Security, Reliability, Cost Management and a lot more.

## Cloud With DevOps.
By using smart automation and a "always-on" architecture, DevOps lets you push updates while people are actually using the site—zero downtime, zero drama. Whether you have 100 users or a billion, the platform stays secure and scales automatically so it never crashes or lags. It turns your cloud from just a "place for code" into a powerhouse that handles growth without breaking a sweat.
                                                           Nobody likes seeing a "Site Under Maintenance" page—it's the fastest way to lose a user's trust. DevOps fixes this by building a bridge between your local code and the cloud that never closes.

# AWS is mostly used cloud platfrom in the World.

I start using AWS during my DevOps journey.
I created a Free tier account for self cloud learning as AWS (Cloud) is most important part of every devops.



# Exploring Services of AWS.
AWS provides 100+ services but i learn which can be the best for DevOps daily workflows.

## First Service of AWS- EC2.

Starting with EC2- Elastic Cloud Compute. This service is used to create virtual machines or server called as Instance.
I was create my First instance just give it name select OS image, Architecture, Instance type- t3.micro, Key- .pem for using that instance with SSH, Network, Storage configuration and LAUCH INSTANCE. It was just take 5 min. to create that instance.

Connect that instanec with my windows using OpenSSH and .pem Key that was downlaoded while creating my Instance


## Created IAM User

I was created a IAM user to know how IAM work in AWS: User, Groups, Policies, Roles.

1. Right now just created noraml user with default policies, After login to user account: nothing was accessable.
2. Create policies for user: IAM user now access EC2 Service: While put the user into default EC2 policies.

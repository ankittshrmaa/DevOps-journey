# VPC in EC2.

The Concept VPC- Virtual private cloud is so importance in EC2 that the whole EC2 instance and architecture is depend upon: i tried to learn VPC deeply as these is properly linked
with DevOps daily workflow.

### VPC Core Components:
1. Subnet, CIDR
2. Router
3. Internet gateway (IGW)
4. NAT gateway
5. Security group
6. IP's
7. Network Access Control List

### In simple VPC is the whole networking and Security of EC2 Instance.
### This is the part i think takes alot time to understand for me, But i tried to undersatnd and go as deeper i can!!

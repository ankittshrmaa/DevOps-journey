echo "Hello world!"


# #!/bin/bash: This is called a shebang. It tells the system that this script should be run using the Bash shell. 
# It's important to include this at the top of your script to ensure it runs correctly.

# To Run Bash Script:

# 1. Save the script to a file, for example, first.sh.
# 2. Make the script executable by running: chmod +x first.sh
# 3. Run the script using: ./first.sh

# Jenkins

Jenkins is an automation server widely used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). It automates repetitive tasks such as building, testing, and deploying applications, helping ensure deployments are reliable, consistent, and fast.

It enables the creation of pipelines composed of multiple stages (implemented as jobs), where each stage performs a specific task in the software delivery lifecycle. By executing these jobs automatically, Jenkins reduces manual intervention and minimizes human error.

I will document the tasks I complete during my DevOps journey using this tool.

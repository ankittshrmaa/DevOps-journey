# Downlaod Jenkins on AWS EC2 Instance.

I use t3.small instance: Ubuntu 22, 2 vCPU, 2GB Ram, 10GB storage.

Instance name: project-1
PC: office
Key name: project-1.pem

### Note: In instance take a look at Inbound Rule and Outbound Rule
1. Inbound is that I will access instance from my PC: should allow SSH to connect and for Jenkins I have to enable Custom port: TCP--> 8080.
2. Outbound should be enable for all: then Instance is able to access on internet (Ping is working on Outbound all.)



# Download docs for Jenkins:
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debian-weekly

1. Install Java.
2. Download Jenkins (Long Term support.)
3. Enable it, Check status.
4. From AWS enable: Inbound traffic:  TCP 8080 port ,Jenkins wok on HTML but I will encrypt further by own.

5. From your PC access it my http://publicip:8080
6. Jenkins default-access-key:  cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword     Copy and paste and then create account for Jenkins.

### GOO


### Note: If need to change port of Jenkins use reverse proxy like nginx to host it on 80 port rather then 8080.

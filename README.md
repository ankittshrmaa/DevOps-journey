### DevOps-journey

I am starting to build my career as a DevOps Engineer. Currently, I am working as an IT Executive – Monitoring and Support.

## Why DevOps

In the past, I was not deeply interested in this field. It always felt confusing and complex to me. I initially wanted to become a programmer or a data analyst. However, when I joined Finvasia as an IT Executive, I was introduced to this ecosystem in a real, practical way.

My responsibility was to monitor dashboards in Grafana and escalate alerts to the DevOps or relevant teams. I was looking at clean, powerful dashboards every day, but I did not understand what was happening behind them.

That curiosity pushed me to start learning what actually powers those dashboards. I wanted to understand how code moves from a developer’s local machine to production. Many junior developers only push their code to GitHub, and their work ends there. But what happens after that?

That is where the real engineering begins.

The DevOps process—building the architecture, designing the infrastructure, managing deployments, monitoring systems—completely changed my perspective. Understanding the flow from code commit to production environment opened a new level of thinking for me.

## Since then, my interest in DevOps has grown continuously. I am committed to improving every day and working toward mastering this field.

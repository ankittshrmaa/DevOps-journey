Not I complete learning about EC2 not go ahead for VPC: Virtual Private Cloud.

### VPC: Its a private network inside the cloud.
 I had created a VPC for my depth understanding and to know how the network architecture works.

 ### Complete Learning.
 1. IGW: Internet gateway.
 2. NACL: Network Access Control List.
 3. Route Table
 4. Subnet: Public & Private, CIDR
 5. Availability Zones.
 6. NAT Gateway

 ### Problems:
1. Subnetting: why we gave public and private subnet.
2. CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing: How IP's configured. /24 = 255.255.255.0.

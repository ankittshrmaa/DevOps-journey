I setup Garfana, prometheus.

I want to learn about monitoring tools, as these are the parts of DevOps journey. 

#Monitoring
1. I downlaod node_exporter in linux to export matrix...
2. Downlaod Prometheus in linux that convert matrix into readable logs,   Prometheus are working in 9090 port by deault. 
3. Garfana downlaod in windows as i have to create dashboard in Host machine. Port 3000 by default

1 and 2 ------> WSL (Linux )  in gust machine.
3. -------> Grafana in windows in Host machine.


#WSL export logs and Monitoring on Host Window.

Node-exporter------> Prometheus--------> Grafana Dashboard
WSL---------------> Windows

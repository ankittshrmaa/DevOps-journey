# I setup Garfana, prometheus.

I want to learn about monitoring tools, as these are the parts of DevOps journey. 

### Monitoring
1. I downlaod node_exporter in linux to export matrix...
2. Downlaod Prometheus in linux that convert matrix into readable logs,   Prometheus are working in 9090 port by deault. 
3. Garfana downlaod in windows as i have to create dashboard in Host machine. Port 3000 by default

1 and 2 ------> WSL (Linux )  in gust machine.
3. -------> Grafana in windows in Host machine.


### WSL export logs and Monitoring on Host Window.

Node-exporter------> Prometheus--------> Grafana Dashboard
WSL---------------> Windows

### Promethesus Configuration of .yml

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

  - job_name: "node"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]

### Grafana + Prometheus
Prometheus send metrix to Grafana 
Grafana shows that matrix as Good Dashboards and Visuals

# add data resources in garfana as Prometheus URl 


and add any test query 
100 - avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[1m])) * 100 
if its shows any output the connect was establish

## connection sucessful
WSL ---> node-exporter----> Prometheus------> Grafana Dashboard

## Start learning AWS as this is the most important part of DevOps.
Right now, i create a free tier AWS account for my learning.
1. Create my First EC2 instance...
2. Connect it with my laptop using openSSH. and AWS key.
3. And just terminate after that


## Will learn more and spend time in AWS to deep dive into it.
